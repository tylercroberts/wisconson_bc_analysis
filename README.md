# Wisconson Breast Cancer Data Exploration and Analysis

This project takes a look at the University of Wisconson's diagnostic data classification of potential breat cancer tumors. In it, I perform feature selection to reduce the number of features used from 30 to 5, which will allow diagnosticians to identify the most important measurements necessary to identify malignant tumors. After performing feature selection, I fit several models in order to compare effectiveness at tumor classification.


All of the analysis is done in a Jupyter notebook, and to replicate it, simply clone the GitHub repository, and run all cells in the notebook.

The dataset can be found inside this repository, but for more information such as a data dictionary, references, and other details, please see the official site [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
